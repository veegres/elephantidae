# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, you can write to us ([#ivory](https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C0304HP1ZSM) on postgres slack). We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Enhancements](https://github.com/veegres/ivory/issues)
  * [Good for newcomers](https://github.com/veegres/ivory/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  * [Supported versions](SECURITY.md)
  * [Setup Local Environment](docker/development/README.md)
  * [Build Frontend](web/README.md)
  * [Build Backend](service/README.md)

## Testing

We don't have tests yet, so you need to test everything manually and good practice, before creating PR to make regrassion testing of all functionality. It is not requriered, but if you not sure or you change some critical part, it is better to spend some time doing this.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Ivory](https://github.com/veegres/ivory/compare) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

*comming soon...*

Thanks,
Andrei Sergeev
