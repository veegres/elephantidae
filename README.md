# Ivory (patroni cluster visualization)

Ivory is a open-source project which is designed to simplify and visualize work with postgres clusters

Ivory allows you to do such things as:
- [keep all of your cluster in one place](https://github.com/veegres/ivory/blob/master/doc/clusters.md)
- [monitor cluster status, do reinit and switchover](https://github.com/veegres/ivory/blob/master/doc/overview.md)
- [edit config of the cluster](https://github.com/veegres/ivory/blob/master/doc/config.md)
- [clean bloat](https://github.com/veegres/ivory/blob/master/doc/bloat.md)
