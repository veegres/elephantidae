# [â˜°](../README.md) Clusters

In the first block Ivory gives you the view of all clusters that you have added. You can add cluster manually or by auto
button (button on the left side near add/plus), auto addition provides wizard which requires only one instance of the
cluster and all other instances are going to be detected automatically. Inside the table you can see brief overview which
instances are in the cluster, which one leader or replica and whether cluster have some problems or not.

Above this block you can find tags which helps you to navigate between different clusters and assign them to the cluster
(it can be done [here](overview.md)). On the right side you can see the warning mark with number of problematic clusters,
it helps when you have so many clusters that cannot be all displayed in one page.

If you want to operate or check more information about the cluster you need to check some of them by clicking on the
cluster name.
